        <p style="font-size: 24px; color:#99EA0B">1. Websites must not contain any hateful and harmful content.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
          All sites applying to the webring must not contain any form of hateful content. This includes and is not limited to any sort of harassment, unfair treatment and violation of an individual or group's dignities and rights in relation to Sex, Gender, Ethnicity, Religion, Disability, Orientation, Age, or Educational Background.

        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 24px; color:#99EA0B">2.Inactive websites, websites with broken links, etc. will not be accepted.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
          All sites applying to the webring should contain actual content and should be actively updated. Members are given a grace period of 3-4 months before their site is deemed "inactive" and removed from the webring. In the case that you move websites, please email me at <span style="color:#99EA0B">webmaster@milkyway.moe</span> so I can update your info accordingly.
          <br><br>
          Exceptions may be made for sites that are going through renovations or are just getting started with applying content. Please email me at <span style="color:#99EA0B">webmaster@milkyway.moe</span> so i may be notified of whatever changes may happen to the website.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 24px; color:#99EA0B">3.Websites containing directly hosted links to pirate material for non-archival purposes will not be accepted.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
          Sites must not contain any non-archival related pirated material. This webring is solely focused on the art and community surrounding piracy and warez. We at <span style="color:#99EA0B">OnlineWire</span> are not a cracking or warez group, nor do we claim to be as such. You may link to resources, like <span style="color:#99EA0B">FMHY</span>, but hosting pirated material on the site itself may put other users in jeopardy. I hope you understand.
          <br><br>
          If the material is on your site for archival purposes (e.g. The material is rarely available or hard to access legally), then you may continue with caution.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 24px; color:#99EA0B">4. If your website contains NSFW/adult content, please mark it accordingly!</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
          Your site needs to be properly marked and contain warnings for NSFW content. (secret code: <span style="color:#99EA0B">'torrentseed'</span>) If you have full porn/gore on your site, you are more than likely to be removed. The webring only accepts sites coded with anything between a Web-G to a Web-MA rating in mind. This means no full on nudity or graphic violence.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, to apply to the webring, you must be at least 15 years old. By applying, you acknowledge that you may be able to see content that may not be appropriate for your age. Lumi or anyone at OnlineWire can not be held responsible for the contents of the sites on the webring. We can only recieve reports.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 24px; color:#99EA0B">5. Your site must consistenly follow the rules.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
          Sites may be removed if any rule breaking material is added to the site after the date of acceptance. You will not be accepted back until you remove the offending material.
